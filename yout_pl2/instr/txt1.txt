- Some things are not normal. By that I mean if you go out in the world and start measuring things like human height, IQ,
0:08
or the size of apples on a tree. You will find that for each of these things, most of the data clusters around some average value.
0:16
This is so common that we call it the normal distribution, but some things in life are not like this.
0:24
- Nature shows power laws all over the place. That seems weird. Like, is nature tuning itself to criticality?
0:30
- If you make a crude measure of how big is the world war by how many people it kills, you find that it follows a power law.
0:37
The outcome will vary in size over 10 million, 100 million.
0:42
- It's much more likelihood of really big events than you would expect from a normal distribution,
0:47
and they will totally skew the average. - The system you're looking at doesn't have any inherent physical scale.
0:54
It's really hard to know what's gonna happen next. - The more you measure, the bigger the average is,
0:59
which is really weird, it sounds impossible. - It's very important to try to understand which game you're playing
1:06
and what are the payoffs going to be in the long run. - In the late 1800s, Italian engineer Vilfredo Pareto
1:13
stumbled upon something no one had seen before. See, he suspected there might be a hidden pattern
1:19
in how much money people make. So he gathered income tax records from Italy, England, France, and other European countries,
1:26
and for each country he plotted the distribution of income. Each country he looked at, he saw the same pattern,
1:34
a pattern which still holds in most countries to this day, and it's not a normal distribution.
1:41
If you think about a normal distribution like height, there's a clearly defined average and extreme outliers basically never happen.
1:48
I mean, you are never going to find someone who is, say, five times the average height, that would be physically impossible,
1:55
but Pareto's income distributions were different. Take this curve for England, it shows the number of people
2:00
who earn more than a certain income. The curve starts off declining steeply, most people earn relatively little,
2:07
but then it falls away gradually, much more slowly than a normal distribution would,
2:12
and it spans several orders of magnitude. There were people who earned 5 times, 10 times,
2:18
even 100 times more than others. That kind of spread just wouldn't happen if income were normally distributed.
2:25
Now to shrink this huge spread of data, Pareto calculated the logarithms of all the values
2:30
and plotted those instead. In other words, he used a log-log plot, and when he did that,
2:36
the broad curve transformed into a straight line. The gradient was around negative 1.5.
2:42
That means each time you double the income, say, from 200 pounds to 400 pounds, the number of people earning at least that amount
2:50
drops off by a factor of two to the power of 1.5, which is around 2.8.
2:55
And this pattern holds for every doubling of income. So Pareto could describe the distribution of incomes
3:01
with one simple equation. The number of people who earn an income greater than or equal to X is proportional to one over X
3:08
to the power of 1.5. Now, that's what Pareto saw for England, but he performed the same analysis on data from Italy,
3:16
France, Prussia, and a bunch of other countries, and he saw the same thing again and again.
3:22
Each time the data transformed into a straight line and the gradients were remarkably similar.
3:28
That meant Pareto could describe the income distribution in each country with the same equation,
3:34
one over the income to some power, where that power is just the absolute gradient
3:39
of the logarithmic graph. This type of relationship is called a power law.
3:45
When you move from the world of normal distributions to the world of power laws, things change dramatically.
3:51
So to illustrate this, let's take a trip to the casino to play three different games.
3:57
At table number one, you get 100 tosses of a coin. Each time you flip and it lands on heads, you win $1.
4:05
So the question is, how much would you be prepared to pay to play this game? Well, we need to work out
4:11
how much you'd expect to win in this game and then pay less than that expected value. So the probability of throwing a head is 1/2.
4:18
Multiply that by $1 and multiply that by 100 tosses, that gives you an expected payout of $50.
4:25
So you should be willing to pay anything less than $50 to play this game. Sure, you might not win every time,
Expected Values
4:31
but if you play the game hundreds of times, the small variations either side of the average will cancel out and you can expect to turn a profit.
4:39
One of the first people to study this kind of problem was Abraham de Moivre in the early 1700s.
4:44
He showed that if you plot the probability of each outcome, you get a bell-shaped curve, which was later coined the normal distribution.
4:51
- Normal distributions, the traditional explanation is that when there are a lot of effects that are random
4:56
that are adding up, that's when you expect normals. So like how tall I am depends on a lot of random things,
5:03
about my nutrition, about my parents' genetics, all kinds of things, but if these random effects are additive,
5:10
that is what tends to lead to normals. - At table number two, there's a slightly different game.
5:17
You still get 100 tosses of the coin, but this time, instead of potentially winning a dollar on each flip,
5:23
your winnings are multiplied by some factor. So you start out with $1,
5:29
and then every time you toss a head, you multiply your winnings by 1.1. If instead the coin lands on tails,
5:36
you multiply your winnings by 0.9. And after 100 tosses, you take home the total,
5:41
that is the dollar you started with times the string of 1.1s and 0.9s.
5:46
So, how much should you pay to play this game? Well, on each flip, your payout can either grow or shrink,
5:53
and each is equally likely each time you toss the coin, so the expected factor each turn
5:59
is just 1.1 plus 0.9 divided by two, which is one. So if you start out with $1,
6:05
then your expected payout is just $1. That means you should be willing to pay anything less than a dollar to play this game, right?
6:13
Well, if you look at the distribution of payouts, you can see that you could win big. If you tossed 100 heads,
6:19
you'd win 1.1 to the power of 100. That's almost $14,000,
6:24
although the chance of that happening is around 1 in 10 to the power of 30. You'd be more likely to win the lottery
6:29
three times in a row. On the other hand, the median payout is around 61 cents. So if you're only playing the game one time
6:36
and you want even odds of turning a profit, well, then you should pay less than 61 cents.
6:42
Though either way, if you played the game hundreds of times, your payout would average out to $1.
6:48
Now, watch what happens if we switch the x-axis from a linear scale to a logarithmic scale. Well, then you see the curve transforms
6:54
into a normal distribution. That's why this type of distribution is called a log normal distribution.
7:01
- When random effects multiply, if I have a certain wealth and then my wealth goes up by a certain percentage next year
7:08
because of my investments, and then the year after that, it changes by another random factor,
7:14
as opposed to adding, I'm multiplying year after year. If you have a big product of random numbers,
7:19
when you take the log of a product, that's the sum of the logs. So what was a product of random numbers
7:26
then gets translated into sums of logs of random numbers, and that's what leads
7:32
to this so-called log normal distribution. And log normal distributions produce big inequalities.
7:38
You don't just see a mean, you see a mean with a big long tail. It's much more likelihood of really big events,
7:45
in this case, tremendous wealth being obtained, than you would expect from a normal distribution.
7:51
- The reason this curve is so asymmetric is because the downside is capped at zero, so at most, you could lose $1,
7:58
but the upside can keep growing up to nearly $14,000. Now let's go on to table three.
8:05
Again, you'll be tossing a coin, but this time you start out with a dollar and the payout doubles each time you toss the coin
8:12
and you keep tossing until you get a heads, then the game ends. So if you get heads on your first toss, you get $2.
8:20
If you get a tails first and then hit a heads on your second toss, you get $4. If you flipped two tails and then a head,
8:27
on your third toss, you'd get $8, and so on. If it took you to the nth toss to get a heads,
8:32
you would get two to the n dollars. So, how much should you pay to play this game?
8:38
Well, as in our previous example, we need to work out the expected value. So suppose you throw a head on your first try,
8:45
the payout is $2 and the probability of that outcome is a half, so the expected value of that toss is a dollar.
The St. Petersburg Paradox
8:52
If it takes you two tosses to get a heads, then the payout is $4 and the probability of that happening is one over four,
8:59
so again, the expected value is $1. We also need to add in the chance that you flip heads on your third try,
9:05
in that case, the payout is $8 and the probability of that happening is one over eight, so again, the expected value is $1.
9:13
And we have to keep repeating this calculation over all possible outcomes. We have to keep adding $1 for each of the different options
9:20
for flipping the coin, say, 10 times until it lands on heads or 100 times before you get heads.
9:26
I know it's extremely unlikely, but the payout is so huge that the expected value of that outcome is still a dollar,
9:33
so it still increases the expected value of the whole game. This means that, theoretically,
9:39
the total expected value of this game is infinite. This is known as the St. Petersburg paradox.
9:47
If you look at the distribution of payouts, you can see it's uncapped, it spans across all orders of magnitude.
9:53
You could get a payout of $1,000, $100,000, or even a million dollars or more.
9:59
And while a million dollar payout is unlikely, it's not that unlikely, it's around one in a million.
10:06
Now, if you transform both axes to a log scale, you see a straight line with a gradient of negative one.
10:12
The payout of the St. Petersburg paradox follows a power law. The specific power law in this case
10:18
is that the probability of a payout x is equal to x to the power of negative one or one over x.
10:24
In the previous games when you have a normal distribution or even a log normal distribution, you can measure the width of that distribution,
10:31
its standard deviation. And in a normal distribution, 95% of the data fall within two standard deviations
10:37
from the mean. But with a power law, like in the St. Petersburg paradox, there is no measurable width,
10:43
the standard deviation is infinite. This makes power laws a fundamentally different beast
10:50
with some very weird properties. - Imagine you take a bunch of random samples and then average them
10:55
and then take more random samples and average them, you'll find that the average keeps going up,
11:01
it doesn't converge. And the more you measure, the bigger the average is,
11:06
which is really weird, it sounds impossible, but it's because it has such a heavy tail,
11:12
meaning the probability of really whopping big events is so significant that if you keep measuring,
11:18
occasionally you're gonna measure one of those extreme outliers and they will totally skew the average.
11:24
It's sort of like saying, if you're standing in a room with Bill Gates or Elon Musk,
11:30
the average wealth in that room is gonna be 100 billion dollars or something (laughs)
11:36
because the average is dominated by one outlier. - And that same idea, one outlier can dominate the average,
Outliers Dominate Averages
11:43
shows up online too. A handful of companies, servers, and data centers hold the personal information
11:49
of millions of people, so when one of them gets hacked, it can have ripple effects across the whole network.

12:48
I'll put the link down in the description. I'd like to thank NordVPN for sponsoring this video. And now, back to power laws.
12:56
So, why do you get a power law from the simple St. Petersburg setup?
13:01
If you look at the payout x, you can see it grows exponentially with each toss of the coin,
13:07
x equals two to the n. But if you look at the probability of tossing the coin that many times to get a heads,
13:14
you can see that this probability shrinks exponentially. So the probability of flipping a coin n times
13:20
is 1/2 to the power of n. But we're not really interested in the number of tosses, we're interested in the payout.
13:26
Now we know that x equals two to the n, so instead of writing two to the n in our probability equation, we can just write x.
13:32
So we end up with this, the probability of a payout of x dollars is equal to one over x,
13:38
or in other words, x to the power of negative one. - You put them together,
13:44
the exponentials conspire to make a power law. And that's a very common thing in nature,
13:49
that a lot of times when we see power laws, there are two underlying exponentials that are dancing together to make a power law.
13:57
- One example of this is earthquakes. If you look at data on earthquakes, you find that small earthquakes are very common,
14:03
but earthquakes of increasing magnitudes become exponentially rarer.
14:09
But the destruction that earthquakes cause is not proportional to their magnitude, it's proportional to the energy they release.
14:15
And as earthquakes grow in magnitude, that energy grows exponentially. - So there's this exponential decay
14:21
in frequency of earthquakes of a given magnitude and an exponential increase in the amount of energy released
14:29
by earthquakes of a certain magnitude. So when you combine those two exponentials
14:34
to eliminate the magnitude, what you find is a power law. - But power laws also reveal something deeper
14:40
about the underlying structure of a system. To see this in action, let's go back to the third coin game
14:46
and the St. Petersburg paradox. Now, you can draw all the different outcomes as a tree diagram
14:51
where the length of each branch is equal to its probability. So starting with a single line of length one
14:56
and then 1/2 for the first two branches, 1/4 for the next four, and so on. Now, when you zoom in,
15:03
you keep seeing the same structure repeating at smaller and smaller scales. It's self-similar like a fractal,
15:10
and that's no coincidence. We see the same fractal-like pattern in the veins on a leaf,
15:15
river networks, the blood vessels in our lungs, even lightning, and in all of these cases,
15:20
we can describe the pattern with a power law. Power laws and fractals are intrinsically linked.
Fractals and Power Laws
15:26
That's because power laws reveal something fundamental about a system's structure. - So I've got a magnet and I've got a screw,
15:34
and you'll notice if I bring them close together, then the screw gets attracted to the magnet,
15:39
and that's because there's a lot of iron it, which is ferromagnetic. But watch what happens if I start heating this up.
15:46
Trying to... Oh! You see that? Ah, there it went! There it went! You see, you heat it up and suddenly it becomes nonmagnetic.
15:54
To find out what happened, let's zoom in on this magnet. - Inside a magnet, each atom has its own magnetic moment,
16:01
which means you can think of it like its own little magnet or compass. If one atom's moment points up,
16:06
its neighbors tend to point that way too since this lowers the system's overall potential energy. Therefore at low temperatures,
16:12
you get large regions called domains where all the moments align. And when many of these domains also align,
16:19
their individual magnetic fields reinforce to create an overall field around the magnet.
16:24
But if you heat up the magnet, each atom starts vibrating vigorously. The moments flip up and down
16:31
and so the alignment can break down. And when all the moments cancel out, then there's no longer a net magnetic field.
16:38
Now, if you have the right equipment, you can balance any magnetic material right on that transition point,
16:44
right between magnetic and nonmagnetic. This is called the critical point and it occurs at a specific temperature
16:51
called the Curie temperature. I asked Casper and the team to build a simulation to show what's going on inside the magnet
16:58
at this critical point. - Each pixel represents the magnetic moment of an individual atom.
17:04
Let's say red is up and blue is down. Now, when the temperature is low, we get these big domains
17:10
where the magnetic moments are all aligned and you get an overall magnetic field. But if we really crank up the temperature,
17:17
then all of these moments start flipping up and down and so they cancel out and the magnet loses its magnetism,
17:23
so that's exactly what happened in our demo. But if we tune the temperature just right,
17:29
right to that Curie temperature, then the pattern becomes way more interesting.
17:34
- This looks like a map. - Like a map? - Yeah, it almost looks like the Mediterranean or something.
17:40
It's almost stable, like atoms that are pointing one way tend to point that way for a while,
17:49
but there is clearly fluctuations as well, so domains are constantly coming and going.
17:56
It's both got some elements of stability and some persistence over time,
18:02
some features which are consistent, but it's also not locked in place
18:08
because you notice changes over time. - [Casper] If you zoom in, you find that the same kinds of patterns
18:14
repeat at all scales. You've got domains of tens of atoms, hundreds, thousands, even millions.
18:20
There's just no inherent scale to the system, that is, it's scale-free, it's just like a fractal.
18:26
And if you plot the size distribution of the domains, you get a power law.
18:31
- The underlying geometry suddenly shows a fractal character that it doesn't have on either side of the phase transition.
18:38
Right at the phase transition, you get fractal behavior and that pops out as a power law.
18:43
- In fact, whenever you find a power law, that indicates you're dealing with a system that has no intrinsic scale,
18:49
and that is a signature of a system in a critical state, which turns out has huge consequences.
18:56
- See, normally in a magnet below the Curie temperature, each atom influences only its neighbors. If one atom's magnetic moment flips up,
19:04
then that means that its neighbors are slightly more likely to point up too. But that influence is local,
19:09
it dies out just a few atoms away. But as the magnet approaches its critical temperature, those local influences start to chain together.
19:16
One spin nudges its neighbor and that neighbor nudges the next and so on, like a rumor spreading through a crowd.
19:22
And the result is that the effective range of influence keeps expanding, and right at the critical point,
Self-Organized Criticality
19:28
it becomes effectively infinite. A flip on one side can cascade throughout the entire material.
19:35
So you get these small causes, just a single flip, to reverberate throughout the entire system.
19:41
- And it gets right into that point where the system is maximally unstable,
19:47
anything can happen. It's also maximally interesting in a way. It means the system is most unpredictable,
19:55
most uncertain, it's really hard to know what's gonna happen next, and that seems to be a natural procedure
20:00
that happens in many different systems in the world. - One such system is forest fires.
20:06
In June, 1988, a lightning strike started a small fire near Yellowstone National Park.
20:12
This was nothing out of the ordinary. Each year, Yellowstone experiences thousands of lightning strikes.
20:17
Most don't cause fires and those that do tend to burn a few trees, maybe even a few acres before they fizzle out.
20:24
3/4 of fires burn less than 1/4 of an acre. The largest fire in the park's recent history
20:30
occurred in 1931. That burned through 18,000 acres, an area slightly larger than Manhattan.
20:37
But the 1988 fire was different, that initial spark spread slowly at first
20:42
covering several thousand acres. Then over the next couple of months, it merged with other small fires
20:47
to create an enormous complex of megafires that blazed across 1.4 million acres of land.
20:54
That's around the size of the entire state of Delaware. That's 70 times bigger than the previous record,
21:01
and 50 times the area of all the fires over the previous 15 years combined.
21:07
So, what was so special about the 1988 fires? Well, to find out, we made a forest fire simulator.
21:13
- We've got a grid of squares, and on each square, either a tree could be there, it could grow,
21:20
or it could not be there. There's gonna be some probability for lightning strikes. So the higher that probability,
21:26
the more fires we're gonna have. We can run this. - So trees are growing. - [Casper] Trees are growing,
21:32
- Forest is filling in. Nice. Getting pretty dense.
21:38
- What do you expect is gonna happen? - I expect to see some fires.
21:43
Probably, you know, now that... Oh! That was good, that was a good little fire.
21:49
Whoa! Whoa!
21:54
No way! Well, that's crazy. You haven't adjusted the parameters, right?
22:00
It's just like- - Not yet, not yet. - This seems like a very critical situation just by itself.
22:07
I say that because of how big that fire was. - This sort of system will tune itself to criticality,
22:14
and you can see it start to happen. So right now, I think it's a good moment where you have basically domains
22:19
of a lot of different sizes. And then one way to think about it is if some of these domains become too big,
22:26
then you get a single fire like that one, perfectly timed. - Burns them all out. - It's just gonna propagate
22:31
throughout the whole thing and burn it back down a little. But then if it goes too hard, then now you've got all these domains
22:37
where there are no trees and so it's gonna grow again to bring it back to that critical state. - I can see how it's the feedback mechanism, right,
22:45
that the fire gets rid of all the trees and there's nothing left to burn, and then that has to fill in again.
22:51
- [Casper] Yeah. - Yeah. But if there hasn't been a fire, then the forest gets too thick and then it's ripe for this sort of massive fire.
23:00
- For a magnet, you have to painstakingly tune it to the critical point, but the forest naturally drives itself there.
23:06
This phenomenon is called self-organized criticality. Yeah, and if you let it run, what you get is, again, a power law distribution.
23:15
So this is log-log, so it should be a straight line. - That kind of stuff seems so totally random
23:22
and unpredictable, and it is in one way, and yet it follows a pattern. There's a consistent mathematical pattern
23:28
to all these kind of disasters. It's shocking. - Is there something fractal about this?
23:36
- Mostly in terms of the, I guess, domains of the trees when you're at that critical state.
23:42
So you get very dense areas, you get non-dense areas. And as a result, when a single lightning bolt strikes,
23:48
you can get fires of all sizes. Most often you get small fires of 10 or fewer trees burning.
23:54
A little less frequently, you get fires of less than 100 trees. And then every once in a while,
23:59
you get these massive fires that reverberate throughout the entire system. Now, you might expect that because the fire is so large,
24:06
there has to be a significant event causing it, but that's not the case because the cause for each fire is the exact same,
Why do we light controlled forest fires?
24:13
it's a single lightning strike. The only difference is where it strikes and the exact makeup of the forest at that time.
24:21
So in some very real way, the large fires are nothing more than magnified versions of the small ones,
24:27
and even worse, they're inevitable. So what we've learned is that for systems in a critical state,
24:32
there are no special events causing the massive fires. There was nothing special about the Yellowstone fire.
24:39
- In 1935, the US Forest Service established the so-called 10:00 AM policy.
24:44
The plan was to suppress every single fire by 10:00 AM on the day following its initial report.
24:49
Now, naively, this strategy makes sense. I mean, if you keep all fires under strict control,
24:54
then none can ever get out of hand. But it turns out this strategy is extremely risky.
25:01
- So let's say we're gonna bring down the lightning probability, so it's very small,
25:06
only one in a million right now, and we're also gonna crank up the tree growth a little bit.
25:12
Now what do you think is gonna happen? - We're gonna get some big fires, I would imagine, like a lot of not fire and then some huge fires.
25:21
Yeah. (Derek laughs) - [Casper] Yep. - Oh boy.
25:27
- [Casper] So nowadays, the fire service has a very different approach. They acknowledge that some fires are essential
25:32
to make the megafires less likely. So they let most small fires burn and only intervene when necessary.
25:39
In some cases, they even intentionally create small fires to burn through some of the buildup,
25:44
though it could take years to return the forest to its natural state after a century of fire suppression.
25:49
But it's more than just the Earth's forests that are balanced in this critical state.
25:54
Every day, the Earth's crust is moving and rearranging itself. Stresses build up slowly as tectonic plates rub against each other.
26:02
Most of the time, you get a few rocks crumbling, the ground might move just a fraction of a millimeter,
26:07
but the stresses dissipate in many earthquakes that you wouldn't even feel. - There are really tiny earthquakes
26:13
that are happening right now beneath your feet, you just can't feel 'em because they're very small.
26:19
But they are earthquakes, they're driven by small slipping movements in the Earth's crust.
26:25
- [Casper] But sometimes those random movements can trigger a powerful chain reaction.
26:30
- [Derek] In Kobe, Japan, the morning of January 17, 1995 seemed just like any other. This was a peaceful city,
26:36
and although Japan as a country is no stranger to earthquakes, Kobe hadn't suffered a major quake for centuries.
How We Can Predict Earthquakes
26:42
Generations grew up believing the ground beneath them was stable, but that morning, deep underground,
26:48
a stress released nearby the Nojima fault line. The stress propagated to the next section of the fault
26:54
and the next. Within seconds, the ruptured cascaded along 40 kilometers of crust, shifting the ground by up to two meters
27:01
and releasing the energy equivalent of numerous atomic bombs. The resulting quake destroyed thousands of homes
27:07
along with most major roads and railways leading into the city. It killed over 6,000 people
27:12
and forced 300,000 from their homes. - How far it goes depends a lot on chance
27:19
and the organization of all that stress field in the Earth's crust. And it just seems to be organized in such a way
27:26
that it is possible oftentimes for the earthquake to trickle along an avalanche
27:31
along a long way and produce a very large unusual earthquake. But if you look at the process behind that earthquake,
27:37
it is exactly the same physical process. It's just that the earthquake-generating process
27:43
naturally produces events that range over an enormous range of scale, and we're not really used to thinking about that.
27:50
- We have this ingrained assumption that we can use the past to predict the future, but when it comes to earthquakes
27:56
or any system that's in a critical state, that assumption can be catastrophic because they're famously unpredictable.
28:02
So, how can you even begin to model something like the behavior of earthquakes? - [Derek] In 1987, Danish physicist Per Bak
28:09
and his colleagues considered a simple thought experiment. Take a grain of sand and drop it on a grid,
28:15
then keep dropping grains on top until at some point the sandpile gets so steep that the grains tumble down onto different squares.
28:23
- What they looked at was the size of these, what they were calling avalanches,
28:28
these reorganizations of numbers of grains of sand. They asked for how often do you see avalanches
28:34
of a certain size. - This is the most simple version of a sandpile simulator
28:40
that you could almost imagine. We're gonna drop a little grain of sand at first always in the center,
28:45
and then it's just gonna keep going up. For one grain, it'll be fine. For two grains, it'll be fine. Three grains, it'll be fine,
28:51
but it's on the edge of toppling. And then when it reaches four or more, it's gonna basically go.
28:58
It feels a bit like a, I don't know, pulsing thing, like something's trying to escape or something, very video game-like.
29:05
That seemed pretty crazy. And it is symmetrical. - Yeah, nice geometric features.
29:11
- So this might be interesting because right now we passed it at a point where this middle one is gonna go,
29:17
and then you look around it and you see, essentially you can think of these brown
29:25
or these three tall grain stacks as being maximally unstable.
29:30
They're about to go, and so you could think of them as these fingers of instability.
29:35
If anything touches them, like, they're just gonna go. (lively music)
29:42
- I see it propagating out. - It's cool seeing it slower. I feel like you can see several waves
29:50
propagating at the same time. - Some people have reasoned that the Earth's crust becomes riddled with similar fingers of instability
29:57
where you get stresses building up, and then when one rock crumbles, it can propagate along these fingers,
30:03
potentially triggering massive earthquakes. If you look at the data, there's some even more compelling evidence
30:09
that links the sandpile simulation to earthquakes. - Let's say instead of dropping it at the center,
30:15
pretty unrealistic to have it drop in the center, I'm gonna drop at random.
30:23
- Hah! That's crazy. - You can actually see it tune itself to the critical state.
30:30
Like at the start, you only see these super tiny avalanches and then now it's everything.
30:36
- It has to build up. - We can slow down a little.
30:42
Oh, and that's a super clean power law. There are events of all sizes.
30:47
One grain of sand might knock over just a few others or it could trigger an avalanche of millions of grains
30:53
that cascade throughout the entire system. And if you look at the power law you get from the sandpile simulation,
31:00
it closely resembles the power law of the energy released by real earthquakes.
31:05
But if you look at the sandpile experiment more closely, it doesn't just resemble earthquakes.
31:10
What does it remind you of? - Forest fires. - [Casper] Right? It feels like it's the exact same behavior.
31:16
- That's the really surprising thing, and that's why this little paper with a sandpile was published in the world's top journal
31:23
because it did something that people just didn't really think was possible. - Now, what's ironic is if you look at real sandpiles,
31:31
they don't behave like this. - Okay, you said sand, I'm gonna do an experiment on a real sandpile.
31:37
And of course, it doesn't follow a power law distribution of avalanches at all. It's totally wrong.
31:43
(Steven and Derek laugh) Per Bak, naturally, gets a chance to reply to the criticism,
31:49
and he says, I'm pretty close to quoting, he says, "Self-organized criticality
31:54
only applies to the systems it applies to." (Steven laughs) So he doesn't care,
32:00
the fact that his theory is not relevant to real sandpiles. So what? Get out of my face.
32:05
He's interested in bigger fish to fry than sandpiles. It's like, you're taking me too literally.
Critical Systems and Universality
32:12
I'm talking about a universal mechanism for generating power laws. And the fact that it doesn't work in real sand
32:18
is uninteresting to him. I thought that took some real nerve. - You could think about the Earth
32:26
and the Earth going around the Sun. That's a very complex system. You've got the molten core,
32:32
everything sloshing around, and you've got oceans, and you've even got the moon going around the Earth, which in theory, you know,
32:38
all should affect the exact motion of the Earth around the Sun. But Newton ignored all of that,
32:44
all he looked at was just a single parameter, essentially, the mass of the Earth.
32:50
And with that, he could correctly, for the most part, predict how the Earth was gonna go around the Sun. Similarly here,
32:56
there are people that have looked at these phenomena that go to the critical state, in this case it's self-organized criticality,
33:03
is it brings itself there, and what they find is that there's this universal behavior where it doesn't even really matter what the subparts are,
33:11
you just get the behavior that's the exact same. - At that critical point
33:16
when all the forces are poised and the system is right on that delicate balance between being organized, highly organized,
33:24
or being totally disorganized, it turns out that almost none of the physical details
33:29
about that system matter to how it behaves. There's just a universal behavior that is irrespective
33:37
of what physical system you're talking about. The term that was used is called universality,
33:42
and it's kind of a miracle, it means you can make extremely powerful theories without involving any technical details,
33:49
any real details of the material. - What this means is that you could have these systems that on the surface seem totally different,
33:57
but when you get to the critical point, they all behave in the exact same way. The other thing you could do is instead of this being trees,
34:05
you could imagine it being people and the thing that's spreading- - Is disease. - Is disease, yeah.
34:12
- You almost get something for nothing at these critical points. - See, many of these systems fall into what's known
34:18
as universality classes. Some of them you need to tune to get there, like magnets at their Curie temperature
34:24
or fluids like water or carbon dioxide at their critical point, but some other systems
34:29
seem to organize themselves to criticality, like the forest fires or sandpiles or earthquakes.
34:36
But what's crazy is that if you succeed in understanding just one system from a class,
34:41
then you know how all the systems in that class behave, and that includes even the crudest simplest toy models,
34:48
like the simulations we've looked at. So you can model incredibly complex systems
34:53
with the most basic of models. And some people think this critical thinking applies even further.
34:59
When we look around the world, there are lots of systems that show the same power law behavior that we see in this critical systems.
35:05
It's in everything from DNA sequencing to the distribution of species in an ecosystem
35:10
to the size of mass extinctions throughout history. We even see the same behavior in human systems,
35:16
like the populations of cities, fluctuations in stock prices, citations of scientific papers,
35:22
and even the number of deaths in wars. So some people argue that these systems
35:27
and perhaps many parts of our world also organize themselves to this critical point.
35:33
- So the fact that all these natural hazards, as they call them, floods, wildfires, and earthquakes,
35:38
they all follow power law distributions means that these extreme events are much more common
35:45
than you would think based on normal distribution thinking. - If you find yourself in a situation
35:50
or an environment that is sort of governed by a power law, how should you change your behavior?
35:56
- If you have events with one of these power distributions, what you're seeing most of the time is small events.
36:04
And this can lull you into a false sense of security, you think you understand how things are going.
36:10
You know, floods for example, there are a lot of small floods, and then every once in a while, there's a huge one. One response to this is insurance,
36:18
that insurance is designed precisely to protect you against the large rare events
36:24
that would otherwise be very bad. But then there's the other side of that picture,
36:29
which is you are the insurance company that needs to insure people and they have a particularly difficult job
How Some Businesses Are Built On Power Laws
36:35
because they have to be able to say how much to charge so that they have enough money to pay out
36:41
when the big bad thing comes along. - [Derek] In 2018, a forest fire tore through Paradise, California,
36:47
it became the deadliest and most destructive fire in the state's history, but the insurance company, Merced Property & Casualty,
36:54
hadn't planned for something that huge, and when the claims came in, they just didn't have the reserves to pay out.
37:01
So just like that, the company went bust. - But while extreme events can cripple some companies,
37:07
there are entire industries that are built on power law distributions. Between 1985 and 2014,
37:15
private equity firm Horsley Bridge invested in 7,000 different startups and over half of their investments actually lost money,
37:23
but the top 6% more than 10xed in value and generated 60% of the firm's overall profit.
37:29
In fact, the best venture capital firms often have more investments that lose money, they just have a few crazy outliers
37:36
that show extraordinary growth, a few outliers that carry the entire performance.
37:41
In 2012, Y Combinator calculated that 75% of their returns came from just two out of the 280 startups they invested in.
37:50
So venture capital is a world that depends on taking risks in the hope that you'll get a few of these extreme outliers
37:57
which outperform all of the rest of the investments combined. - [Derek] Book publishers operate in a similar fashion,
38:03
most titles flop, but in 1997, a small independent UK publisher called Bloomsbury
38:09
took a chance on a story about a boy wizard. The boy's name, of course, was Harry Potter,
38:14
and now Bloomsbury is a globally recognized brand. We see a similar pattern play out on streaming platforms.
38:21
On Netflix, the top 6% of shows account for over half of all viewing hours on the platform.
38:26
On YouTube, less than 4% of videos ever reach 10,000 views, but those videos account for over 93% of all views.
38:35
- All these domains follow the same principle that Pareto identified over 100 years ago where the majority of the wealth goes to the richest few.
38:43
The entire game is defined by the rare runaway hits. - But not every industry can play this game.
38:50
Like if you're running a restaurant, you need to fill tables night after night. You can't have one particularly busy summer evening
38:56
that brings in millions of customers to make up for a bunch of quiet nights. Over a year, the busy nights and quiet ones balance out
39:02
and you're left with the average. Airlines are similar, an airline needs to fill seats on each flight.
39:08
You can't squeeze a million passengers onto one plane, so it's the average number of passengers over the year
39:13
that defines an airline's success. - We're used to living in this world of normal distributions and you act a certain way,
39:20
but as soon as you switch to this realm that is governed by a power law, you need to start acting vastly different.
39:26
It really pays to know what kind of world or what kind of game you're playing. - That is good. That's good, yes.
What game are you playing? Normal or power?
39:32
You should come on camera and just say that just like that. You were on camera, you just did do it.
39:37
(Steven laughs) - If you are in a world where random additive variations cancel out over time,
39:42
then you get a normal distribution. And in this case, it's the average performance, so consistency, which is important.
39:50
But if you are in a world that's governed by a power law where your returns can multiply and they can grow over many orders of magnitude,
39:57
then it might make sense to take some riskier bets in the hope that one of them pays off huge. In other words,
40:03
it becomes more important to be persistent than consistent. - [Derek] Though as we saw in the second coin game,
40:08
totally random multiplicative returns give you a log normal distribution, not a power law.
40:14
To get a power law, there must be some other mechanism at play. In the early 2000s,
40:19
Albert-László Barabási was studying the internet, and to his surprise, he found that there was no normal webpage
40:26
with some average number of links. Instead, the distribution followed a power law. A few sites like Yahoo
40:32
had thousands of times more connections than most of the others. Barabasi wondered what could be causing
40:38
this power law of the internet, so he made a simple prediction. As new sites were added to the internet,
40:43
they were more likely to link to well-known pages. To test this prediction, he and his colleague Réka Albert ran a simulation.
40:51
They started with a network of just a few nodes and gradually they added new nodes to the network with each new node more likely to connect to those
40:59
with the most links. As the network grew, a power law emerged. The power was around negative two,
41:05
which almost exactly matched the real data of the internet. - [Casper] Look at that. - [Derek] That's fun.
41:11
- It's still so satisfying. This will basically also distribute a power law. One of the ideas here is that this could be individuals
41:18
or even companies, and so if you're more likely to become more successful or more well known
41:25
or successful you already are, you're gonna get this sort of runaway effect where you get a few that sort of dominate the distributions.
41:33
I wonder if part of the takeaway is like if you're playing some sort of game that is dominated by a power law,
41:39
then you better do the work as much of it as early as possible so you get to benefit from the snowball effect, essentially.
41:46
- Yeah, I guess that's a good idea. I'm not sure whether you can control it, though. Human beings like to think of ourselves
41:52
as being a bit special, and that maybe somehow because we're intelligent and have free will.
41:59
We will escape the provenance of the laws of physics
42:05
in order and organization, but I think that's probably not the case. So if you look at the number of world wars,
42:12
and if you make a crude measure of how big is the world war by how many people it kills,
42:18
which is a bit macabre, but still, you find that, again, it follows a power law
42:23
virtually identical to the power law you find in stock market crashes. - So if the world is shaped by power laws,
42:30
then it feels like we're poised in this kind of critical state where two identical grains of sand,
42:36
two identical actions can have wildly different effects. Most things barely move the needle,
42:42
but a few rare events totally dwarf the rest, and that, I think, is the most important lesson.
42:47
If you choose to pursue areas governed by the normal distribution, you can pretty much guarantee average results.
42:54
But if you select pursuits ruled by power laws, the goal isn't to avoid risk, it's to make repeated intelligent bets.
43:00
Most of them will fail, but you only need one wild success to pay for all the rest.
43:06
- And the thing is that beforehand you cannot know which bet is going to be because the system is maximally unpredictable.
43:12
It could be that your next bet does nothing, it could do a little bit, or it could change your entire life.
43:18
In fact, around three years ago, I was reading this little book, and in the book there was this little line
43:23
saying something like, "One idea could transform your entire life." So right underneath that, I wrote,
43:29
"Send an email to Veritasium." A couple days later, I wrote an email to Derek, saying, "Hey, Derek, I'm Casper.
43:36
I study physics and I can help you research videos." I didn't hear back for four weeks, so I was getting pretty sad
43:42
and just wanted to forget about it and move on, but then a couple days later I got an email back saying,
43:49
"Hey, Casper, we can't do an internship right now, but how would you like to research, write,
43:54
and produce a video as a freelancer?" So I did, and that's how I get started at Veritasium.
44:04
Hey, just a few quick final things. All the simulations that we used in this video we'll make available for free for you to use
44:11
in the link in the description. And the other thing is that we just launched the official Veritasium game.
44:18
It's called Elements of Truth and it's a tabletop game with over 800 questions. It's the perfect way to challenge your friends
44:25
and see who comes out on top. Now, at Veritasium, we're all quite competitive, so every time we play, things get a little bit heated,
44:32
but that's honestly a big part of the fun. Now, when we launched on Kickstarter, we got a lot of questions asking
44:39
if we could ship to specific countries. And originally we didn't enable this, and this is our mistake,
44:45
this is on us and we totally hear you, but I'm glad to say that right now we have enabled worldwide shipping.
