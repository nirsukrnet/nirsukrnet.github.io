Hi everyone. Welcome back to High
0:06
English Channel. We're so happy you're
0:09
here again with us. I'm Emily
0:11
and I'm Paul. On this channel, we help
0:14
you speak real natural English with
0:17
confidence, like you're talking to a
0:18
friend, not reading a textbook.
0:21
Today, we have a really interesting
0:23
topic. It's something that almost every
0:26
English learner struggles with. That
0:28
strange moment when your brain knows
0:30
what to say, but your mouth just
0:33
freezes.
0:34
Exactly. You understand everything, but
0:37
when it's time to talk, nothing comes
0:39
out. Your mouth feels stuck. Don't
0:42
worry. Today will help you fix that.
0:45

0:52
English lessons for you.
0:54
So, Emily, be honest. When you were
0:56
learning English, did your mouth ever
0:58
freeze?
0:59
Oh, yes. Many times. I could understand
1:02
movies, songs, everything. But when
1:06
someone asked me a simple question, I
1:08
just stood there, mouth open, brain
1:11
empty.
1:12
That's so common. The truth is, most
1:15
learners train their brain, but not
1:17
their mouth.
1:18
Right? We study grammar, take notes, and
1:21
watch videos, but we almost never move
1:24
our mouth to make English sounds.
1:27
That's why this episode is special. We
1:29
won't talk about grammar rules today.
1:32
Instead, we'll train your mouth like a
1:34
muscle.
1:35
Like going to the gym, but for speaking
1:37
English.
1:38
Exactly. Your mouth gym. And here's the
1:41
best part. It only takes 5 minutes a
1:44
day.
1:45
5 minutes? That's shorter than one Tik
1:48
Tok scroll session.
1:50
Exactly. If you give us just five
1:52
minutes each day, your English will
1:54
sound smoother and more natural in 30
1:57
days.
1:58
Sounds amazing. Let's start. So, Paul,
2:02
why does our mouth freeze when we try to
2:04
speak English?
2:05
Good question. Think about how you study
2:08
English. You listen, you read, you
2:10
write. That means you train your brain
2:13
and ears. But when do you actually train
2:15
your mouth?
2:17
Not very often. Maybe only in class or
2:20
when we talk to a friend.
2:22
Right. So your brain understands
2:24
English, but your mouth muscles are not
2:27
ready.
2:28
Wait, mouth muscles?
2:30
Yes. Your lips, your tongue, your jaw,
2:33
they're muscles, just like your arms or
2:35
legs. If you don't train them, they
2:37
can't move correctly.
2:39
That makes sense. It's like reading a
2:41
hundred books about swimming, but never
2:44
getting in the pool. You still can't
2:46
swim.
2:47
Exactly. You can know every rule, every
2:50
word, but if you never open your mouth
2:52
to speak, it won't work.
2:54
And our mouth is used to our first
2:56
language. It knows the sounds, rhythm,
2:59
and flow.
3:01
Yes. But English has a totally different
3:03
rhythm. It connects words, uses soft
3:06
sounds, and has rising and falling
3:08
tones. So your mouth gets confused.
3:11
It's like trying to dance with new
3:13
steps. Your legs just don't know what to
3:16
do.
3:17
Exactly. And that's when confidence
3:19
disappears. You try to speak, it feels
3:22
weird, and your brain says, "See, you're
3:24
not good at this."
3:26
But the truth is, you're not bad at
3:28
English. You're just untrained.
3:32
Exactly. Untrained is not the same as
3:35
bad. You just haven't given your mouth
3:37
enough practice. So, Paul, if someone's
3:40
listening and thinking, "That's me. My
3:43
mouth always freezes." What should they
3:45
know?
3:46
They should know this. Your mouth can
3:49
change. You can train it just like you
3:51
train your body.
3:53
And you don't need a teacher or
3:55
expensive classes. You only need 5
3:58
minutes a day.
3:59
Exactly. Just 5 minutes with four simple
4:02
steps. warm-up, mirror practice, shadow
4:06
speaking, and the fluency loop.
4:08
Four steps, 5 minutes. I like that.
4:12
Let's go through them one by one.
4:14
Step one, warm up. Just like before you
4:17
exercise, you warm up your muscles.
4:20
So, we warm up our mouth muscles, too.
4:23
How?
4:24
Very simple. First, lip rolls. Make a br
4:28
sound like a motorcycle. Do it for 5
4:31
seconds three times.
4:33
Like
4:35
that's fun.
4:36
Exactly. Second tongue stretch. Push
4:40
your tongue out, then pull it back
4:41
slowly. Do it five times.
4:44
That feels funny, but I can feel my
4:47
mouth waking up.
4:48
Yes. Third, jaw loosening. Open your
4:52
mouth wide like a big yawn. Then close
4:55
it slowly. Do that five times.
4:58
Okay. What's the last one?
5:00
Smile stretch. Give a big smile. Hold
5:03
for three seconds. Then relax. Do that
5:06
three times.
5:08
So, lip rolls, tongue stretch, jaw
5:12
loosening, smile stretch. Got it.
5:15
Exactly. It only takes 1 minute, but it
5:18
wakes up your mouth completely.
5:20
Okay, our mouth is ready. What's next?
5:23
Step two, mirror practice. My favorite.
5:27
What do we do?
5:29
Stand in front of a mirror. Look at
5:31
yourself and say one strong sentence
5:33
like I am learning to speak confidently
5:37
or this is my voice. I own it.
5:41
Perfect. Say it five times. Start slow
5:44
then a little faster. Watch your lips
5:47
and face as you speak.
5:49
That's interesting. Many people are
5:51
scared to look at themselves speaking
5:53
English.
5:55
Exactly. But after a few days, the
5:57
mirror becomes your friend, not your
5:59
enemy. I love that idea. So, this step
6:02
takes about 1 minute, right?
6:04
Yes. Now, we've done 2 minutes total.
6:07
Ready for step three?
6:09
Let's go.
6:10
Step three is called shadow speaking.
6:13
It's one of the most powerful ways to
6:15
train your mouth.
6:16
Shadow speaking sounds mysterious. What
6:19
is it? It means listening to a short
6:22
English sentence and repeating it
6:24
immediately trying to match the same
6:26
rhythm, tone, and emotion like you're
6:29
the speaker's shadow.
6:31
Ah, that's why it's called shadow. So, I
6:33
copy the speaker exactly.
6:36
Exactly. Don't think about grammar.
6:38
Don't translate. Just listen and copy.
6:42
That's how your brain connects English
6:43
sounds directly to your mouth.
6:46
That makes sense. Where can we find
6:48
sentences for this?
6:50
Anywhere. YouTube, podcasts, short
6:53
videos, movies, even this episode. Just
6:56
take a 5 to 10 second clip.
6:59
Can you give an example?
7:01
Sure. Let's say I say, "I don't think
7:03
that's a good idea."
7:05
Okay.
7:06
Now, you repeat right after me. Same
7:08
tone, same rhythm. I don't think that's
7:11
a good idea.
7:13
I don't think that's a good idea.
7:15
Good. You're not just repeating, you're
7:17
feeling the flow. That's what shadow
7:19
speaking does.
7:21
It's interesting. When I copy someone's
7:23
voice, my pronunciation and rhythm get
7:26
better without thinking too hard.
7:28
Exactly. It trains your ears, mouth, and
7:31
brain at the same time. It's like a real
7:34
time workout.
7:35
How long should learners do shadow
7:37
speaking each day?
7:38
Only about two minutes. Choose two or
7:41
three short sentences and repeat them
7:43
several times. That's enough.
7:46
So, now we're at four minutes total.
7:48
What's the final step?
7:50
Step four is the fluency loop where we
7:53
practice speed and flow.
7:55
Speed? That sounds hard.
7:58
Not really. Let me show you. Pick one
8:00
sentence like, I'm going to improve my
8:03
English.
8:04
Okay. I'm going to improve my English.
8:08
Great. Now, say it slowly. I'm going to
8:12
improve my English.
8:14
I'm going to improve my English.
8:18
Good. Now say it normally like in
8:20
conversation.
8:22
I'm going to improve my English.
8:24
Perfect. Now faster, but still clear.
8:28
I'm going to improve my English.
8:30
Yes, that's one fluency loop. You can do
8:33
this with any sentence. Slow, normal,
8:36
fast. Repeat three times. It's like
8:39
training a song until the rhythm feels
8:41
natural.
8:42
Exactly. In just 1 minute, your mouth
8:45
becomes faster and smoother.
8:48
So, all four steps take only 5 minutes.
8:51
One for warm-up, one for mirror, two for
8:54
shadow, one for fluency.
8:56
Yes, 5 minutes a day. But if you do it
8:59
consistently, your English will sound
9:02
completely different after 30 days.
9:04
That's incredible. It's simple but
9:07
powerful.
9:08
It really works. But there's one more
9:11
thing. Even if your mouth is trained,
9:13
you still need to understand how English
9:15
really sounds.
9:17
What do you mean by that?
9:19
Well, many learners sound robotic
9:21
because they speak word by word. I am
9:24
going to the market.
9:27
Yes, it sounds correct but not natural.
9:31
Exactly. Native speakers connect words
9:34
in small groups. We call them sound
9:36
clusters. Little groups of words that
9:39
move together.
9:40
Can you give an example?
9:42
Sure. The textbook version says, "I am
9:45
going to the market." But a native
9:47
speaker says, "I'm going to go to the
9:49
market."
9:50
Oh, it's faster and smoother, like
9:52
music.
9:54
Exactly. Here's another one. What are
9:56
you doing becomes, "What you doing?"
9:59
What you doing? Wow. I've heard that in
10:02
movies.
10:03
Right. Did you eat becomes did you eat
10:06
and I don't know becomes I don't know.
10:09
That's so different. So the secret is
10:12
learning these clusters. The real flow
10:14
of English.
10:16
Exactly. Try this mini exercise. Choose
10:19
three clusters like going to wanna and
10:22
lemie.
10:23
Okay. Three clusters.
10:25
Now say them like a rhythm. Gonna gonna
10:28
gonna wanna wanna wanna let me let me
10:31
let me
10:32
That's fun.
10:34
Exactly. Then use them in full
10:36
sentences. I'm going to go now. Do you
10:39
want to see it? Let me know if you need
10:41
help.
10:42
That feels so natural. Like singing a
10:44
little song.
10:46
Exactly. If you practice just three
10:48
clusters every day, your English will
10:51
sound smoother and more real.
10:53
So English is not only about words. It's
10:56
about the music between words.
10:59
Beautifully said. English has rhythm,
11:01
tone, and flow. Just like music, when
11:04
you feel the rhythm, you start to own
11:06
the language.
11:08
I love that. But Paul, there's still one
11:11
big question. What if someone's too
11:13
nervous to speak?
11:15
Ah, yes. That's where the real challenge
11:17
begins. The mind. You can train your
11:20
mouth perfectly, but if your mind is
11:22
full of fear, your voice disappears.
11:25
So true. Confidence comes from the mind,
11:29
not just the mouth.
11:30
Exactly. That's why we need to train
11:32
both your mouth and your mind together.
11:36
Okay, I'm listening. What's the secret
11:38
to training the mind?
11:40
First, speak with emotion, not
11:42
perfection. Most students focus on
11:45
grammar. Did I say it right? But people
11:47
don't remember your grammar. They
11:49
remember your energy.
11:51
That's powerful. Can you show me an
11:53
example? Sure. Listen. I'm happy to be
11:57
here. Flat. Now again. I'm happy to be
12:01
here. Full of energy.
12:03
Oh, same sentence but completely
12:06
different feeling.
12:08
Exactly. That's why emotion matters more
12:10
than perfect grammar.
12:12
So we should practice with emotions like
12:15
angry, excited, nervous.
12:18
Exactly. Take one simple line like it's
12:21
going to be a great day. Say it in
12:23
different moods.
12:25
Excited. It's going to be a great day.
12:28
Nervous. It's going to be a great day.
12:32
Angry. It's going to be a great day
12:34
whether I like it or not.
12:37
Perfect. When you do this, your brain
12:39
stops focusing on mistakes and starts
12:42
feeling the language.
12:44
That's such a fun way to practice.
12:46
Now, here's the third tip for your mind.
12:49
Create shortcuts.
12:51
Shortcuts? You mean like faster ways to
12:54
think in English?
12:56
Exactly. Most learners always translate
12:59
everything into their first language.
13:01
That slows your brain down. Instead,
13:04
connect English directly to meaning or
13:07
feeling.
13:08
So, when I hear, "Let's catch up
13:11
sometime," I shouldn't translate each
13:13
word. I should just feel that it means a
13:16
friendly invitation.
13:18
Exactly. Or when someone says, "I'm
13:21
starving." Your brain should think, "I'm
13:23
very hungry." Not translate word by
13:26
word.
13:27
That makes everything faster. You
13:29
respond naturally, not like a computer
13:31
processing language.
13:33
Exactly. That's how fluency begins.
13:36
Connection, not translation.
13:39
I like that. So, what's the third tip
13:41
for the mind?
13:43
Use your whole body when you practice.
13:46
My body, not just my mouth.
13:49
Yes. Stand up, move your hands, walk
13:52
while speaking. When your body moves,
13:55
your voice becomes stronger and your
13:57
confidence grows.
13:58
Oh, like when actors rehearse lines with
14:01
movement, it feels more real.
14:04
Exactly. Speaking English isn't just
14:07
about your tongue. It's about energy,
14:09
posture, and presence.
14:11
That's such a different way to learn.
14:13
Most people just sit at a desk,
14:16
right? But fluency is physical. You
14:19
can't whisper your way to confidence.
14:21
You have to speak with your whole body.
14:23
I like this idea. So, can we combine the
14:26
body and mind training with the mouth
14:29
training?
14:30
Yes. And it only takes 5 minutes. Let me
14:33
show you a mini routine.
14:35
I'm ready.
14:36
Minute one. Choose three sentences you
14:39
like and say them with strong emotion.
14:41
happy, excited, or confident.
14:44
Okay, so I might say, "I can do this.
14:47
I'm proud of myself. Today is my day."
14:50
Perfect. That wakes up your energy.
14:53
Minute two, act those sentences like a
14:56
short movie scene. Imagine you're
14:58
performing. Exaggerate the emotion.
15:02
That's fun. I'll be the star of my own
15:04
English drama.
15:06
Exactly. Minute three. Walk around your
15:09
room while saying the same lines. Let
15:11
your body move naturally.
15:13
Got it.
15:14
Minute four. Stand in front of the
15:16
mirror. Look into your own eyes and say
15:19
the same sentences again with power.
15:22
That sounds strong.
15:24
It is. And minute five, record yourself.
15:28
Then listen, not to find mistakes, but
15:30
to hear your energy and confidence.
15:33
That's so different from normal English
15:35
practice. It's not about being perfect.
15:38
It's about being alive in English.
15:41
Exactly. Because fluency is not perfect
15:43
grammar. It's freedom.
15:45
Freedom of expression.
15:48
Exactly. And now let's talk about one
15:50
more secret to fluency. How you repeat.
15:54
Oh, repetition. I think most people
15:58
already repeat a lot, but maybe the
16:00
wrong way.
16:01
Yes. Many learners repeat like robots. I
16:05
am going to the market. I am going to
16:08
the market. Same tone, same speed, no
16:11
change.
16:12
That's true. It feels like memorizing,
16:15
not learning.
16:17
Right. Real repetition means you say it
16:19
better each time, not just again.
16:22
So, how do we repeat the right way?
16:25
There's a simple five-stage method.
16:28
Let's take one sentence. For example, I
16:30
don't know what to say.
16:32
Okay, got it? Stage one, slow clarity.
16:36
Say it very slowly three times. Feel
16:39
every sound.
16:41
I don't know what to say.
16:46
Good. That helps your mouth learn every
16:49
sound clearly. Stage two, flow
16:52
repetition. Now say it at normal speed,
16:55
smoothly.
16:56
I don't know what to say.
16:58
Exactly. That's how it sounds in real
17:00
life. Stage three, emotion repetition.
17:04
Say it three times with different
17:05
feelings. Sad, happy, embarrassed.
17:09
Sad. I don't know what to say. Happy. I
17:13
don't know what to say. Embarrassed. Uh,
17:17
I don't know what to say.
17:18
Perfect. That trains your emotional
17:21
range. Stage four, pressure repetition.
17:24
Say it faster, but still clear.
17:27
I don't know what to say. I don't know
17:29
what to say. I don't know what to say.
17:31
Good. Feel the speed, but don't lose
17:34
clarity. And finally, stage five,
17:37
realworld use.
17:39
How does that work?
17:40
Use the same sentence in three different
17:43
situations. For example, job interview.
17:46
I don't know what to say, but I'm very
17:48
grateful. Romantic moment. You're so
17:51
kind. I don't know what to say. Funny
17:53
situation. Wow, that was weird. I don't
17:56
know what to say. Oh, I love that. The
17:59
same sentence but with different
18:01
emotions and situations. It makes it
18:04
real.
18:05
Exactly. And you only need to do this
18:07
with one sentence per day.
18:09
Just one. That's easy.
18:12
Yes. Choose sentences that mean
18:14
something to you, like, "I'm proud of
18:16
how far I've come." Or, "It's okay to
18:18
make mistakes."
18:19
That's such a good reminder. It's not
18:22
about memorizing words. It's about
18:24
feeling them.
18:25
Exactly. Because you're not repeating to
18:28
remember, you're repeating to become.
18:31
Repeat to become. I like that phrase. It
18:34
feels powerful.
18:36
And it really is because when you repeat
18:38
with emotion, you don't just learn
18:40
English. You grow into a more confident
18:43
version of yourself.
18:45
That's beautiful. But Paul, I think we
18:47
all know the hardest part is staying
18:50
consistent.
18:52
Yes, that's the real challenge. Most
18:54
learners don't fail because of
18:56
difficulty. They stop because of
18:58
inconsistency.
19:00
So true. Some people watch many videos
19:02
but never practice. Others practice just
19:06
one minute a day but every single day.
19:09
Exactly. And who becomes fluent? The
19:12
second one. The active learner
19:14
because they take action even when it
19:17
feels small.
19:18
Yes. And not small action repeated daily
19:21
changes everything. Let's be honest,
19:24
most English learners are not bad at
19:27
English. They're just not consistent.
19:30
Exactly. I see two types of learners all
19:33
the time.
19:34
Tell me.
19:35
First, the passive learner. They watch
19:38
hours of English videos, take notes,
19:41
follow many accounts, but never open
19:43
their mouth to speak.
19:45
Yes. And then there's the active
19:47
learner. Someone who maybe studies less
19:50
but speaks more. They pick one sentence,
19:53
repeat it deeply, and train their mouth
19:55
every single day.
19:57
And of course, the second type becomes
19:59
fluent.
20:00
Absolutely. Because they train instead
20:03
of just consume.
20:04
If you're listening right now, ask
20:06
yourself honestly. Which one are you?
20:09
Exactly. Be real with yourself. Are you
20:12
just watching or are you training?
20:14
And sometimes people stay stuck not
20:17
because of laziness, but because of
20:19
fear. Yes, fear is the biggest reason
20:22
people never speak. What if I make
20:25
mistakes? What if I sound stupid? What
20:27
if people laugh?
20:29
That fear feels so real, but it's also
20:32
very expensive.
20:34
Exactly. Fear costs you opportunities, a
20:37
job, a friend, a dream.
20:39
How many conversations have we avoided
20:42
because we were scared? How many chances
20:44
to grow did we miss?
20:46
That's painful to think about. But
20:48
here's the good news. You can't change
20:50
the past, but you can change the next 30
20:53
days.
20:54
Yes, for the next 30 days, you can train
20:57
your mouth for just 5 minutes a day.
21:00
You can do mirror practice. You can
21:02
shadow real voices. You can feel awkward
21:05
and still do it. You can be tired and
21:08
still repeat one sentence
21:10
because fluency is not luck. It's a
21:13
decision, a small daily decision to show
21:16
up.
21:17
Exactly. Fluency grows in quiet moments
21:20
in your bedroom, your kitchen, your
21:22
early morning practice.
21:24
No one sees you train, but one day
21:26
they'll hear your English and say, "Wow,
21:29
you sound amazing."
21:31
And you'll know it's because you
21:32
practiced when no one was watching.
21:35
That's so powerful, Paul. Should we
21:37
review the key vocabulary from today's
21:39
episode before we finish?
21:41
Great idea. Let's make sure everyone
21:43
remembers the important words.
21:46
First word freeze. We said your mouth
21:49
freezes. That means your mouth stops
21:51
moving like water turning into ice.
21:54
Next word train. To train means to
21:57
practice regularly to improve a skill.
22:00
You can train your mouth like a muscle.
22:02
Then we have fluency. It means speaking
22:06
smoothly and easily without stopping too
22:08
much.
22:09
Another one is shadow speaking. Shadow
22:12
means to copy someone closely. So shadow
22:15
speaking means repeating what you hear
22:17
immediately.
22:18
Confidence, belief in yourself and your
22:21
ability to do something. When you have
22:23
confidence, you're not afraid to try.
22:26
We also said sound cluster. A small
22:29
group of words spoken together smoothly
22:31
like going to or wanna.
22:34
And finally, consistent. Doing something
22:37
again and again every day, not just
22:40
once.
22:41
Perfect. So our key words are freeze,
22:44
train, fluency, shadow, confidence,
22:48
cluster, and consistent.
22:50
If you understand these, you understand
22:53
the heart of today's lesson.
22:55
Let's quickly review what we learned.
22:57
We talked about why your mouth freezes
23:00
because you train your brain but not
23:02
your mouth.
23:03
Then we shared the fiveinut daily
23:05
training, warm-up, mirror practice,
23:08
shadow speaking, and the fluency loop.
23:11
We also explored sound clusters, the
23:14
rhythm in music of English.
23:16
And we trained the mind and body
23:18
together with emotion, movement, and
23:20
confidence.
23:22
Then you showed us the five-stage
23:24
repetition method to help us speak
23:26
naturally and emotionally.
23:28
Yes. And finally, we learned that the
23:31
secret to fluency isn't perfection, it's
23:33
consistency.
23:35
5 minutes a day for 30 days can
23:37
completely change your English. You
23:40
don't need a teacher. You don't need
23:41
expensive lessons. You just need a
23:44
mirror, your voice, and a bit of
23:46
commitment.
23:47
I love that. So, Paul, before we close,
23:50
what's our question of the day?
23:52
Good one. Today's question is, what's
23:54
your biggest challenge when speaking
23:56
English?
23:57
Is it fear, pronunciation, finding words
24:00
quickly, or maybe something else?
24:03
Write your answer in the comments below.
24:05
Just one or two sentences.
24:07
For example, my biggest challenge is
24:10
pronunciation. Some English sounds are
24:12
difficult. Or my biggest challenge is
24:15
confidence. I understand, but I feel
24:18
shy.
24:19
We read every comment. And remember,
24:21
writing your answer is also great
24:23
English practice.
24:25
Thank you so much for joining us today.
24:28
We hope you feel inspired to train your
24:30
mouth every single day. Remember, your
24:33
mouth is not bad at English, it's just
24:36
untrained.
24:37
And that can change starting today.
24:40
